Hi Steven, 

Attached is the .tcl for base project I have been using. It was built in Vivado 2022.2. Although 
my problems flashing the QSPI could be with that 
version (see: https://www.hackster.io/whitney-knitter/zynqberry-qspi-boot-workaround-for-
vitis-2021-x-and-later-d56d98). Emilie (Sundancer) is working on a similar project, she also said 
that the fsbl from 2022.2 is broken and if replaced by an fsbl from 2019.2 flashing works. That is 
on a different board however, but chimes with the above blog post. I'll try that next. 

I am new to embedded linux, device trees, QSPI (the list goes on), but as far as I can see 
everything should be in order with regards to my partitions and offsets (see attached pics and 
.bif file written by hand). 

The QSPI image was built in petalinux 2022.2 and packaged using bootgen 2020.2 (Opteran 
reported errors with the 2022.2 Bootgen tool). No errors were reported when building and 
packaging.

And yes, definitely good to be able to get more eyes on what I'm doing. If at least to say "that 
bit is fine". On that note, I have attached my simple system-user.dtsi too. I haven't mentioned 
any QSPI partitions in that, but I didn't think that would matter just yet as I can't even get the 
board to boot over JTAG.

See you Friday, 

Tim

Hi Tim

That's fine regarding the project, it would be great if you can send it over when you get the chance.

I've had a quick look at the problem your currently seeing.

From the boot info it looks like the bit and both elf files are transferring ok but there is error around the 
Device Tree location. Maybe check the DTB image offset locations in the “petalinux-config” menu.

Was the QSPI Linux image created in Vitis? If it was can you show me the “BIF” file? that will contain the 
DTB offset.

Not sure if any of this will help but maybe it can point us in the right direction.

I'm looking forward to working on this project, its always nice to bounce ideas and thoughts off 
someone else.

Regards 
Steve

Hi Steve, 

I think that was a 'broken' test project I used to get the correct Zynq settings from (clocks, DDR 
etc). I used it to put together a base project which just has a few clocks, resets and interrupts. I 
will send that to you later today (I noticed a small problem with it yesterday yesterday). My 
plan was to use a very basic basee project and then add cameras, CAN, etc. until we have a full 
design. 

I have built a petalinux project, packaged the boot.bin but then I get this error when trying to 
flash it into the QSPI:

I'm unclear whether this is a problem with what I have done, or a bug in Vitis/Vivado 2022.2. 
Any clues?

Glad to have you on board! 

Tim

Subject: VCS-3 
 
Hi Tim
 
I am currently looking into the VCS-3 project and recreating the design available  at the following 
location
https://github.com/SundanceMultiprocessorTechnology/VCS-
3/tree/main/Hardware/Vivado/Base_project/2022.1
 
I can build the project from the tcl script however there are a few unconnected pins/ports in the block 
design, just wondering if you also had the same issue when rebuilding the project?
 
Also, just wondering if there a software project for this design, either Petalinux or Bare-metal?
 
Thanks for you help, we have a meeting on Friday so look forward to meeting you then.
 
Steve
